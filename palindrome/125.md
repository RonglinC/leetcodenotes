# Valid Palindrome

converting uppercase into lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters. given string s, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

## palindrome and its reverse are identical to each other.

reverse the given string and compare it with the original.
If those are same, it is a palindrome

```Python
def isPalindrome(self,s):
    s =''.join(ch.lower()for ch in s if ch.isalnum())
    return s ==s[::-1]
```

we using join() to create modifies string that contains only alphanumeric characters in lowercase.

### every palindrome half is reverse of the other half

start in the middle of palindrome, and traverse outwards.they will encounter same characters in the exact same order.
we could go inwards towards the middle.

if we traversing inwards,from both ends of the input string, we can expect see the same characters in the same order.

```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1

        while i < j:
            while i < j and not s[i].isalnum():
                i += 1
            while i < j and not s[j].isalnum():
                j -= 1

            if s[i].lower() != s[j].lower():
                return False

            i += 1
            j -= 1

        return True
```
