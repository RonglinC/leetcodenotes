# Break a Palindrome

replace exactly one charcter with any lowercase so the resutlting string is not a palindrome and that is the lexicographically smallest one possible.

ex: "abccba"-> "aaccba"
ex2: "a" ->""

### greedy approach:

an non-empty palindrome could be odd or even.
even case: divide the string into two halves.
change to non palindrome just change a character in those two halves.
odd case: single character in the middle. 

if the length of the string is 1, return an empty string.
iterate over string from left to middle of string, if character not 'a' change to 'a' and return 

iterate over whole left part, change last character to b and return 

```Python
if len(palindrome) == 1:
            return ""
        middle = len(palindrome)//2
        for i in range(middle):
            if palindrome[i] != 'a':
                return palindrome[:i]+'a'+palindrome[i+1:]
    
        return palindrome[:-1]+'b'
```
