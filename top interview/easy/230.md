# Kth smallest element in a BST

given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value of the values of the nodes in the tree.

## How to traverse the tree

## DFS for tree

    adopt the depth as priority,so that one would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,and then back to root to reach another branch.

    the dfs strategy can be distinguished as preorder,inorder,and postorder depending on the relative order among the root node, left node and right node.

## BFS

    scan through the tree level by level, follwing the order of the height, from top to bottom.

## Recursive Inorder Traversal:

    build inorder traversal of BST which is an array sorted in the ascending order. The answer is the k-1 element of this array.

    The inorder traversal of BST creates a sorted list.
    if the length of resulting list res becomes k, we break the recursion.

    the time is O(h) and the space is O(k).

    ```python
    def kthSmallest_dfs(self,root,k):
        res =[]
        def inorder_DFS(node):
            if not node: return
            inorder_DFS(node.left)
            if len(res) == k:
                return
            res.append(node.val)
            inorder_DFS(node.right)
        inorder_DFS(root)
        return res[-1]
    ```

## Approach 2: Iterative Inorder Traversal

    using stack. this way could speed up the solution because there is no need to build the entire inorder traversal, and one could stop after the kth element.
