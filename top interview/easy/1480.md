# Running Sum of 1d Array

## prefix sum
the brute force is:
```Python
    answer=[]
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        runningsum=0
        for j in range(i+1):
            runningsum+=nums[j]
        answer.append(runningsum)
    return answer
```
for every index i in nums, iterate from 0 to i and sum the elements in the nums to get the running sum.
