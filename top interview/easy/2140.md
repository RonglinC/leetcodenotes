# 2140 Solving Questions With Brainpowers

using dp to solve it
questions[i] we have two option: solve it and skip some question or skip it.
let n be number of questions.
subproblem : array dp[i] is the maximum points we can get by processing the questions in subarray
questions[i,n-1]

intialize an array dp of size n, set dp[n-1] = questions[n-1][0]

initialize an array dp of size n,set dp[n-1] - questions[n-1][0]

iterate backward over index i fro n -2:
    if we skip i, we have dp[i] =dp[i+1]
    if we solve question i, we have dp[i] = questions[i][0]+dp[i+questions[i][1]+1]
