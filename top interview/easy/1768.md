# Merge Strings Alternately

# Two Pointers

iterate over both strings.
i point to first letter of word1, j point to the first letter of word2
use resuts empty string to store the outcome

append the letter pointed to by pointer i, word[i] then increment i by1 to next letter of word1.then we append word2[j] because we need add letters in alternating order. increase j by1.

we stop appending when i reaches the end of word1, stop appending letters from word2 when j reach the end.

here, when creating the string using []
Python strings are immutable, we caannot modified after created.
when we need concatenate large number of strings, creating list of substrings and then join using .join() will be more efficient.
