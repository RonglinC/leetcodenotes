## Approach1 : Linear Time Solution

the time ensure character is unique, you need check the whole string.

The idea is to go through the string and save in hash map the number of times seach character appears in the string. It would  take O(N) time, N is the number of characters in the string.

Go through the string second time, use hash map as reference to check if character is unique or not.If unique, return its index.
The complexity of the second iteration is O(n).

Time complexity is O(N), we go through the string of lenght N.
Space complexit: O(1)


```Python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        character_count = {}
        for index in range(len(s)):
            if s[index] not in character_count:
                character_count[s[index]] = (1, index)
            else:
                character_count[s[index]] = (character_count[s[index]][0] + 1, index)
                
        for character, occurrence_index in character_count.items():
            if occurrence_index[0] == 1:
                return occurrence_index[1]
        return -1
```
