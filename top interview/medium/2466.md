# Count Ways to Build Good Strings

## DP

build an array dp to record the number of good strings with each length.dp[i] be the number of good strings with length i. dp[0] =1 it mean empty string is the only good string with length 0.

either good string either ends with zero of 0s or one of 1s,which is 0 or 11

### The case which end with 0

every good string of length 4 can be turned into a good string of length 5 by appending 0. thus we increment dp[5] by dp[4]. In general will be dp[end] +=dp[end-zero]

### The case which end with 11

every good string of length 3 can be turned into a good string of length 5 by appending 11. Thus we increment dp[5] by dp[3]

it is time to fill the array and find the number of good strings of each length is the range[low-high]

```Python
    def countGoodStrings(self, low: int, high: int, zero: int, one: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (high + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        md = 10 ** 9 + 7
        for i in range(min(zero, one), high + 1):
            if i >= zero:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % md
            if i >= one:
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % md

        s = 0
        for i in range(low, high + 1):
            s = (s + dp[i]) % md
        return s
```
