# Word Search

## Use BackTracking 

this problem is 2D grid traversal problem.
we could solve this problem using backtracking.
if the path does not lead to a solution, we need revert the change.

walk around the 2D grid and at each step, we need mark the choice before jump into the next step. at the end of the step, we revert the mark. the exploration is done via DFS strategy.

## Steps

1. check if we reach the bottom case, that is the word to be matched is empty
2. check if the current state is invalid,either the position is out of the boundary or the letter not match the first lettter of the word
3. if current step is valid, we go exploration.

```python
def exist(self,board,word):
    for r in range(len(board)):
        for c in range(len(board[0])):
            if backtrack(r,c,word):
                return True
    return False
def backtrack(row,col,word):
    if len(word) ==0:
        return True
    if row < 0 or row == len(board) or col <0 or col == len(board[0]) or board[row][col] != word[0]:
        return False
    ret = False
    for rowOffset,colOffset in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
        ret = backtrack(row+rowOffset,col+colOffset,word[1:])
        if ret:
            break
    board[row][col] = word[0]
    return ret


```
