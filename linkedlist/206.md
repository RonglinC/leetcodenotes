# reverse Linked List

## iterative 
while traversing the list, we can change the current node's next point to point to its previous element. node does not have reference to its previous node, we must store its previous node.

```Python
# the first node in reversed list have None
prev = None
curr = head
while curr:
    # store the next one 
    next=curr.next
    # assignmentsomething to curr.next
    curr.next = prev
    # assign the curr to prev
    prev = curr
    #point forward.
    curr =next
return prev
```
