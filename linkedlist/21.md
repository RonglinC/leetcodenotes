# Merge Two Sorted Lists

you are given the heads of two sorted linked list list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two list.return the head of the merged linked list.

input:list1 =[1,2,4], list2=[1,3,4]
output:[1,1,2,3,4,4]

## Recursion solution

when two linked list both are empty,the merge is completed.
decide which one is smaller then call recursion.
the time and space complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are the number of elements in l1 and l2.

my code:

```Python
def recur(list1,list2):
    if list1 and !list2:
        return
    if list1.val < list2.val:
        recur(list1.next,list2)
    else:
        recur(list1,list2.next)
```

correct answer:

```Python
def mergeTwoLists(self,l1,l2):
    # if l1 empty or l2 empty directly return
    if not l1:return l2
    if not l2: return l1
    if l1.val <= l2.val:
        l1.next=self.mergeTwoList(l1.next,l2)
        return l1
    else:
        l2.next=self.mergeTwoList(l1,l2.next)
        return l2
```
