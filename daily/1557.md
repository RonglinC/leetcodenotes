# Minimum Number Of Vertices to Reach

given acyclic graph,with n vertices numbered from  0 to n-1, and an array edges where edge[i] = [fromi, toi] represent a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable.

example: n =6, edges=[[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]

output [0,3]

example: n =5, edges=[[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
output:[0,2,3]

## indegree is number of edges going into a node. 

the input edge list edge[0]is the source node, edge[1] is the destination node.

1. create an indegree list of size n and initialize all elements to 0.
2. iterate through all the edges and update the indegree of each node
3. create an answer list
4. iterate through all vertices and add the ones with an indegree of 0 to the answer list 
5. return the answer list
