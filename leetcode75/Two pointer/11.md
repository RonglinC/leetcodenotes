# Container With Most Water

you are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of ith line are (i,0) and (i,height[i])

find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, contain the most water.
return the maximum amount of water a container can store

input: height=[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
output:49

## The maximum area is decide on shortest line

1. set two pointer i,j both point to h[i], h[j]. In this situation the area is S(i,j)
2. S(i,j) = min(h[i],h[j])*(j-i)
3. each loop, move the shorter line inside one and update the maximum of the area, exit the loop when two pointer meet.

```Python
def maxAre(self,height:List[int])->int:
    i,j,res=0,len(height)-1,0
    while i <j:
        if height[i] < height[j]:
            res = max(res,height[i]*(j-i))
            i+=1
        else:
            res = max(res,height[j]*(j-i))
            j-=1
    return res
```
