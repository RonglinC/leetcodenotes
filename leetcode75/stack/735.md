## stack approach

two stones moving in the same direction can never collide,so whatever two asteroids are moving in opposite directions will collide.

the stack is used to track of the surviving asteroids after the collisions occur. the stack could allow us efficiently compare the current asteroids with the previously encountered asteroids and handle the collision scenarios accordingly.

```Python
def asteroidCollision(self,ats):
    stk=[]
    for t in ats:
        flag = True
        #top element of stack stk[-1] is positive meaning it is moving to the right, current element is 0 mean moving to left
        while flag and stk and stk[-1]>0 and t <0:
            # compare the size of two as
            # assigned -t ensure the size comparisos
            a,b=stk[-1],-t
            # the top stack is smaller than current, remove top element from stack
            if a <= b:
                stk.pop(-1)
            #current asteroid will get destory 
            if a >=b:
                flag = False
        if flag:
            stk.append(t)
        return stk

```
