# String Compression

## my approach:

create a hashmap key is the element, value is the frequencies.
convert it to list then return the list's length.

## pointer 

```Python
def compress(self,chars)->int:
    n = len(chars)
    # i used for loop through array
    i =0
    #write the position
    write = 0
    while i <n:
        j =i
        #用j来找到从i开始相同的字符连续序列的长度
        while j <n and chars[j] == chars[i]:
            j+=1
        chars[write] = chars[i]
        write+=1
        if j-i >1:
            # update the number
            for c in str(j-1):
                chars[write]=c
                write+=1
        i=j
    # represent  the length of string
    return write
```

example walk through:
chars =[a,a,b,b,c,c,c]
n =7, i =0, write = 0
when i =0, nested for loop find char[j] == char[i], both a
increment write to 1
the count is 2, enter the nested loop to convert count into individual charcter
[a,2,b,b,c,c,c]
write to 2
