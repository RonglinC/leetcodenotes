# Product of Array Except Self

given an integer array nums,return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the produce of all the element of nums except nums[i]

the algorithm must runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation

input:nums[1,2,3,4]
output:[24,12,8,6]

input: nums[-1,1,0,-3,4]
output:[0,0,9,0,0]

## My approach

if an array include zero, then it will be 0, then the rest is just product
initialize a pointer point to the start of the array nums,if pointer not equal to i,get the res product and store it in i location in the array temp for example?

question: is it a prefix sum or prefix product?

## Official Solution

oh yeah. my guess is right but i don;t know how to implement prefix sum damnnn.

1. left and right product lists
2. for index i, we will make use of the product of all numbers to the left of it and multiply it by the product of all numbers to the right. give the product of all number except i.

```Python
def product(self,nums:List[int])->List[int]:
    length=len(nums)
    # initialize two array for index i, L[i] contain produce to the left R[i] product to the right
    Left,Right,answer=[0]*length,[0]*length,[0]*length
    # the most left element do not have the left so the produce is only 1
    L[0]=1
    #L[i] = L[i-1]*nums[i-1]
    #L[i-1]contain all the product of elements to the left of i-1,multiply with nums[i-1] that is the element at left of the index i, give all product leftside of i
    for i in range(1,length):
        L[i]=nums[i-1]*L[i-1]
    
    #the most right no element so same is 1
    R[length-1]=1
    for i in reversed(range(length-1)):
        R[i]=R[i+1]*nums[i+1]
    
    for i in range(length):
        answer[i]=L[i]*R[i]
    return answer
```

The time complexity is O(n)
