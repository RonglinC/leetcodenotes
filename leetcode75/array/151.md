# Reverse Words in a String

given a input string s,reverse the order of the words
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

note that s may contain leading or trailling spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.

input: s ="the sky is blue"
output:"blue is sky the"

## Approach 1

remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input string,split the string into individual words using the space as delimiter and store them in a list. Finally we reverse the order of the words in the list and concatenate them back into a string separated by a single space.

```Python
def reverseWords(self,s:str)->str:
    #remove the spaces, and reduce multiple spaces to single space
    s = ' '.join(s.split())
    #split the string into indiviual words and store in list 
    words =s.split()
    # reverse 
    words.reverse()
    return ' '.join(words)
```


## Space complexity O(1) by using two pointers

1.remove the extra space
2. reverse the whole string
3. reverse each words
example: "the sky is blue "
after steps1: "the sky is blue"
after step2: "eulb si yks eht"
after step3: "blue is sky the"

steps1: for loop from beginning to the end, erase when face the space
use two pointers to erase the space-> O(n)

```Python
class Solution:
    #get ride of the space
    def trim(self,s):
        n =len(s)
        left,right=0,n-1
        # get ride of the space at the beginning amd the ending 
        while left<= right and s[left]==' ':
            left+=1
        while left<= right and s[right] ==' ':
            right-=1
        temp=[]
        while left<= right:
            if s[left]!=' ':
                temp.append(s[left])
            elif temp[-1]=' ':
                temp.appeend(s[left])
            left+=1
        return temp
    
    #reverse the string list
    def reverse_string(self,nums,left,right):
        while left<right:
            nums[left],nums[right]=nums[right],nums[left]
            left+=1
            right-=1
        return None
    # reverse each words
    def reverse_words(self,nums):
        start,end =0,0
        n=len(nums)
        while star<n:
            while end< n and nums[end]!=' ':
                end+=1
            self.reverse_string(nums,start,end-1)
            start=end+1
            end+=1
        return None

    #reverse each string's word
    def reverse3(self,s):
        l = self.trim(s)
        self.reverse_string(l,0,len(l)-1)
        self.reverse_word(l)
        return ''.join(l)
