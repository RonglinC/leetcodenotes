# Good Nodes

## recursion

at each recursion call, check if the node is good by compare its value to the integer we pass in to the dfs function

set the root's value to something small, each cell we compare with current node.
if current node value is greater, set this value equal to current node's value.

## Algorithm

Initialize a function dfs, as well as a variable numGoodNodes that keeps track of how many good nodes are in the tree. The function should take two arguments: a node node, and an integer representing the greatest value in the path leading from the root to the current node maxSoFar.

For each call to the function, first check if maxSoFar <= node.val. If so, increment numGoodNodes. Next, call dfs(child, max(node.val, maxSoFar)) for all children of the current node.

Call dfs(root, INT_MIN) and return numGoodNodes.



```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node,maximum):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            count =0
            if node.val >=maximum:
                count+=1
            left = dfs(node.left,max(node.val,maximum))
            count += left
            right = dfs(node.right,max(node.val,maximum))
            count+=right
            return count
        return dfs(root,float("-inf"))
