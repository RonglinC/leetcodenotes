# Mximum Depth of Binray Tree

the binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Recursion

the maximum depth of a binary tree is the maximum number of steps to reach a leaf node from the root node

traverse the tree by dfs or bfs.

```Python
def maxDepth(self,root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    else:
        left = maxDepth(root.left)
        right =maxDepth(root.right)
    return max(left,right)+1
```
