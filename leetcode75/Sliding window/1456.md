# Maximum Number Of Vowels in a substring of given length

given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

input: s="abciiidef", k=3
output:3

input: s ="aeiou",k=2
output: 2

## Sliding Window

the length of the window is fixed as k, we only need to create window at the leftmost side of the string s, and move it one character to the right each time.
the window can cover all subarrays of length k. simply count the number of vowels in each window and record the maximum count

1. loop through array from 0 to k-1, each iteration checks if character at i in s is vowel and increments the count
2. enter another loop iterate from k to length s-1:
   1. increment count by 1 if the character at index i in s is vowel
   2. decrement count by 1 if the character at index i-k in s is vowel(character being removed from window)
   3. update answer to maximum value between answer and count

## example:

s = "leetcode" k =3

1. count =0, answer = count
2. start loop from 0 to 2 as k =3. check if each character is a vowel and increment count.lee contains 2 vowels:('e',and 'e'). count becomes 2
3. set answer to count
4. character at index 3 is t,not a vowel. that's why count remains the same
5. loop moves to index 4. character at index 1(i-k) is 'e' vowel, decrement count by1, count now is 1
6. index 4(rightmost) is 'c', not a vowel. count remain the same
7. moves to index 5,index 2(5-3) is 'e', a vowel, decrement count. count is 0
8. index at 5 is ;o;,increment count by1
9. loop move to index 6, (i-k) = 'e' remove count
10. when loop end, return the maximum answer which is 2.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
        
        # Build the window of size k, count the number of vowels it contains.
        count = 0
        for i in range(k):
            count += int(s[i] in vowels)
        answer = count
        
        # Slide the window to the right, focus on the added character and the
        # removed character and update "count". Record the largest "count".
        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            count += int(s[i] in vowels)
            #i-k is to remove the left part and update the windows size to be k
            count -= int(s[i - k] in vowels)
            answer = max(answer, count)
        
        return answer
