## Relational SQL:

two tables so we need use joins 
there is condition so we need where
using count function for the times

1. select the customer id from visit table
2. use count function give it a name 

count function:
help in counting number of rows:
start at the top-> all rows 
group in the end 
3. use left join to join the visit id 
4. put condition in where clause 
5. group by : 
   1. use group by with aggregate function
   2. groups rows sharing same values in a column
   3. GROUP BY to group the results by customer_id, get one row for each unique customer_id in the table.


```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id  
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL 
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
