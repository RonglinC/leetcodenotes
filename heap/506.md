# Relative Ranks

## Max Heap

1.create an empty heap, each element in heap is tuple (-num,i)where num is the negation of the score and i is the index of the score in the nums.
why we negate the nums is becuse we create max heap instead of min heap.
the heapq module in default is min heap, by neagting score the make the largest smallest.when we pop, we get the score in decending ordder.
2.use heapq.heapify(heap) to convert to heap
3.length of nums list is stored in N
4.list res is created with N empty string
5.count initialized to 1 to keep track of ranks
6.loop runs while heap not empty, each iteration, maximum element is popped.(num,i)
7.if count =1, assign gold
8 if cout beyond 3, assigned string using the count in res list 
9. increment count by 1
10. the res list contain the relative rank
